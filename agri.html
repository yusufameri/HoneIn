						<h2>College of Agriculture and Natural Resources</h2>
					</header>
					<p>“You don't have to get your hands dirty to be an agriculturalist or
            resource scientist. Our programs take you from the classroom straight
            to the lab - complete with the latest research tools and experiments
            funded by state and national partners. Students across our 25-plus
            areas of study work with faculty as they test new theories on campus
            and at five research and education centers in Maryland.
            Whether developing safer, more efficient technologies for the food industry,
            creating new bio-energy systems or crossbreeding wheat genes to find heartier
            varieties, science will be your guide. Consider it good preparation for med or
            vet school. And if you like getting dirty, we can make that happen too.”

            We believe that physical design and social environment are interrelated, and
          that best practice and research should reflect this interconnectedness. All of
          the School's programs benefit from the collaborative environment and cross-disciplinary
          communication among the faculty and students of all the programs.  Our mission is a quality
          built environment that promotes social justice, cultural value, resource conservation and
